# PyP100

PyP100 is a Python library for controlling many of the TP-Link Tapo devices including the P100, P105, P110 plugs and the L530 and L510E bulbs.


## Support

If you would like to support the project, please consider buying me a coffee.

## Installation

PyP100 can be installed using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
  pip install PyP100
```
    

## Usage

#### Plugs - P100, P105 etc.
```python
from PyP100 import PyP100

p100 = PyP100.P100("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123") #Creates a P100 plug object

p100.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
p100.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

p100.turnOn() #Turns the connected plug on
p100.turnOff() #Turns the connected plug off
p100.toggleState() #Toggles the state of the connected plug

p100.turnOnWithDelay(10) #Turns the connected plug on after 10 seconds
p100.turnOffWithDelay(10) #Turns the connected plug off after 10 seconds

p100.getDeviceInfo() #Returns dict with all the device info of the connected plug
p100.getDeviceName() #Returns the name of the connected plug set in the app
```

#### Bulbs - L530, L510E etc.
```python
from PyP100 import PyL530

l530 = PyL530.L530("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123")

l530.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
l530.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

#All the bulbs have the same basic functions as the plugs and additionally allow for the following functions.
l530.setBrightness(50) #Sets the brightness of the connected bulb to 50% brightness
l530.setColorTemp(2700) #Sets the color temperature of the connected bulb to 2700 Kelvin (Warm White)
l530.setColor(30, 80) #Sets the color of the connected bulb to Hue: 30Â°, Saturation: 80% (Orange)
```

#### Energy Monitoring - P110
```python
from PyP100 import PyP110

p110 = PyP110.P110("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123")

p110.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
p110.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

#The P110 has all the same basic functions as the plugs and additionally allow for energy monitoring.
p110.getEnergyUsage() #Returns dict with all of the energy usage of the connected plug
```

#### Error Handling
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError is raised if the IP address is incorrect and the device cannot be reached.

TapoError is raised when an error code is received from the device,
for example, if the email and/or password were incorrect.

FailedTapoRequestException bundles both ConnectionError and TapoError together to make catching both errors simpler.
```python
from PyP100 import PyL530, TapoError

l530 = PyL530.L530("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123")

try:
    l530.handshake()  # Creates the cookies required for further methods
    l530.login()  # Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

    l530.toggleState()
except TapoError.FailedTapoRequestException as e:
    # Handle the error somehow
    print("There was an error: " + str(e))
```
